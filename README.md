# RMarkdown Templates

This repository contains a collection of personal [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) templates. The article, letter, syllabus, and title page have a similar style and use [Linux Libertine](http://www.linuxlibertine.org/) and [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata) fonts, British English spelling, coloured links, double spacing, back references, and numbered sections. Also, the article template already includes all packages required by [kableExtra](https://github.com/haozhu233/kableExtra); it should work out of the box. The syllabus template is a slightly modified version of [Steven Miller's example](https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates/tree/master/syllabus-example) and the letter template borrows a lot from the [linl R package](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/linl/). The presentation template was made with [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) and [xaringanthemer](https://github.com/gadenbuie/xaringanthemer). I would like to thank the authors for sharing their code. I plan to include templates for CVs and academic posters soon.

Each folder contains a pdf with the output of the template. Check them out to see how the documents look like. Comments and suggestions are most welcome.

To compile the pdfs, you need to install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (and the [rmarkdown package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmarkdown)), [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), and a [TeX system](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).
